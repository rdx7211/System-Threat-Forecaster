# 🛡️ System Threat Forecaster

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **System Threat Forecaster** is a machine learning project that predicts the probability of a system being infected by malware, based on its system configurations and telemetry data.  

This project is inspired by the [Kaggle Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction).  
The telemetry data used contains system properties and infection records collected via antivirus software.  

🔍 **Goal:** Predict whether a system is at risk of malware infection.  
💻 **Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Bootstrap.
